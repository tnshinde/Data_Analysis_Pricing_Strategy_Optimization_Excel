üõí Retail Company Data Analysis & Pricing Strategy Optimization üìä
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a Retail Company's sales data, focusing on correlation analysis between pricing and sell-through rates. The insights derived from this analysis are used to develop a data-driven pricing strategy, allowing the business to optimize revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction.

üõ†Ô∏è **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between pricing and sell-through rates for a Retail Company's product categories to inform a strategic pricing approach. The analysis identifies which categories are more price-sensitive, enabling data-driven decisions on price adjustments.

üìä **Dataset Information**

The dataset used includes:
Product Category: Type of product (e.g., Footwear, Women's Apparel, Men's Apparel).
Price: Current selling price of the products.
Sell-Through Rate: The percentage of stock sold within a specific time frame.
Inventory Levels: Stock availability for each product.
The data is stored in an Excel file (retail_data_analysis_correlation.xlsx).

üîç **Analysis Approach**

1. **Correlation Analysis**
Analyzed the relationship between price and sell-through rate to identify how pricing affects customer demand across different categories.
Identified categories with varying levels of price sensitivity:
Moderate sensitivity: Footwear, Women's Apparel.
High sensitivity: Men's Apparel.

3. **Score Matrix** for Price Adjustments
Developed a scoring system to rank products based on demand and inventory levels:
Score 1: High-demand products with low inventory, suitable for price increases.
Score 0: Products with low sell-through or high inventory, not ideal for price adjustments.

5. **Tiered Pricing Strategy**
   
Implemented a 3-tier system for adjusting prices:
Tier 1: Higher price increases (5-10%) for products with very high demand and low stock.
Tier 2: Moderate price adjustments for products with balanced demand and inventory.
Tier 3: Minimal or no price changes for products where demand stability is crucial.

üåü **Key Findings**
Footwear & Women's Apparel: Moderate price sensitivity allows for strategic price increases in high-demand items.
Men's Apparel: High price sensitivity suggests maintaining competitive prices to sustain sell-through rates.
Scoring System: Products scoring 1 can withstand price increases without significantly impacting demand.
Tiered Pricing Strategy: Allows for a balanced approach to optimizing revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction.

üí∞ **Pricing Strategy**
Based on the analysis, a price adjustment strategy was developed:

For high-demand products: Implement slight price increases (5-10%) to maximize revenue.
For price-sensitive categories: Maintain competitive pricing or introduce discounts to boost sales.
